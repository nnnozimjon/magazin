Store (Optional): If you are using Redux or other state management libraries, you can create a 'store' folder to organize your store-related files.

/src
  /store
    - rootReducer.ts
    - store.ts
    /actions
      - actionTypes.ts
      - userActions.ts
      ...
    /reducers
      - userReducer.ts
      ...
